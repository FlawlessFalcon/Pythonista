One of the most useful Python collections is the dictionary.
Recall that a dictionary is an associative data type where you can store keyâ€“data pairs.
The key is used to look up the associated data value. We often refer to this idea as a map.

Map() Create a new, empty map. It returns an empty map collection.
put(key,val) Add a new key-value pair to the map. If the key is already in the map then replace the old value with the new value.
get(key) Given a key, return the value stored in the map or None otherwise.
del Delete the key-value pair from the map using a statement of the form del map[key].
len() Return the number of key-value pairs stored in the map.
in Return True for a statement of the form key in map, if the given key is in the map, False otherwise.
